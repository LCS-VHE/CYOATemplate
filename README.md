# CYOA Story App

This is a story app that my friend and I have built using SwiftUI. Here are some images:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="image1.png" width=405 ></td>
    <td><img src="image2.png" width=405 ></td>
  </tr>
 </table>


You are seeing the story and the node view. The node view shows how many times a section has been visited. The darkder the red means the more times a node has been visted.
